        <h2>About Ulas Kaygisiz and His Blog</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone, I am Ulas. I born on August 4, 2000 in Ankara, Turkey. Although I born in Turkey, I am half Greek and half Kurdish. I came to United States for my undergraduate degree and currently I am a senior studying computer science at Michigan State University.

        <p>In this blog page, I want to share the things that interests me with you. I like doing research about things and talk about them with my parents over phone. However, after some time, I forgot the details of the topics, even forgot that I did research about a specific topic. That is why I decided to keep this blog something like a diary, but decided to write things that are informative and may capture your interest as well. Here are some of my hobbies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chess</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Fishing</li>
            <li>Volleyball</li>
            <li>Technology</li>
            <li>Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope that we will have too much fun sharing things with each other in this blog.</p>
